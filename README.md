## What is it?
A fast and lightweight job client for Hacker News consisting of Y Combinator backed startups. It is minimal by design and focused on displaying job postings in a concise and readable manner, making it easy for users to find the jobs they are interested in. This application is built with Next.js using the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). It uses getStaticProps to fetch data at build time and therefore works as a static site. 

The goal of this project was to create a simple and efficient way for users to find jobs at startups.
